Deploy Static Website on AWS (S3 + CloudFront)
Project: Deploy Static Website on AWS

Student: Bejawada kavya

Website URLs:
- CloudFront Domain Name: https://d2p3pmm72uy6uz.cloudfront.net/
- S3 Website Endpoint: http://my-389023268462-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
- S3 Object URL Example: http://my-389023268462-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

Project Summary:
I created an S3 bucket, enabled static website hosting, and uploaded the website files (index.html, css/, img/, vendor/). 
I set the correct bucket policy to allow public access, then created a CloudFront distribution using the S3 Website Endpoint as the origin. 
Finally, I verified that the website loads correctly via CloudFront, the S3 website endpoint, and the direct S3 object URL.

Customization:
- Changed website title to “Bejawada Kavya’s Travel Blog”
